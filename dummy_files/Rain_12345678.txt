My name is Rain with matrix number, 12345678. I am 
majoring in AI. This is my third time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this 
subject. This is because useful in future.
I acquired SSS for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I 
think I can manage to get SSS for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will burn the mid night oil. Wish me luck!!!Thursday, 18 June 2021 It’s me again. Finally, it’s the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did A* in this course. ……….
